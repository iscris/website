  <h1>About Brazil Data Commons</h1>
  <div style="padding: 2rem;">
    <h2>Why Brazil Data Commons</h2>
    <p>
      Brazil Data Commons is an initiative that aims to highlight data related to Brazil within the Data Commons knowledge graph. 
      This effort brings together public datasets issued by various Brazilian governmental entities, making them accessible via 
      the DC knowledge Graph. Brazil Data Commons is powered by Data Commons.
    </p>
    <p>
      To address modern critical challenges, such as climate change or the Covid-19 pandemic, research must be grounded in solid 
      data analysis. A lot of the data needed by specialists from different areas is already available online from reliable 
      sources, but there is a significant gap between data being available and being easily usable. 
      Data Commons has emerged from the urgency to organize and make the access to all kinds of information easy for those 
      who need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data Commons synthesizes a single graph from these different data sources. It links references to the same entities 
      (such as cities, counties, organizations, etc.) across different datasets to nodes on the graph, so that users can 
      access data about a particular entity aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining. We hope the 
      data contained within Data Commons will be useful to students, researchers, and enthusiasts across different disciplines.
